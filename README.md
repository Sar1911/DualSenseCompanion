# DualSenseCompanion

A basic companion app for the DualSense controller for windows. It will emulator an xbox 360 controller so you can play almost all pc games with your ps5 controller!

Features currently working:
1. Xbox 360 controller emulation.
2. Vibration.
3. USB connectivity.

Features I'm working on currently:
1. Bluetooth support.
2. Hiding the original PS5 controller to avoid conflicts with the emulated 360 controller in some games.

Features I'll be adding in the future:
1. Custom controls mapping.
2. Lightbar customization.
3. Battery indicator.
4. Headphone jack support for game audio.

# DualSense Companion

A basic companion app for the DualSense controller for windows. It will emulate an xbox 360 controller so you can play almost all pc games with your ps5 controller!

What This App Can Do:
1. Xbox 360 controller emulation for a single DualSense(PS5) Controller.
2. USB and BT connectivity support.
3. Rumble support.
4. Automatic hiding of original controller to prevent double input.
5. Dependency check and install on startup.

What I'm currently working on:
1. GUI.
2. Option to enable automatic startup with Windows.
2. Adding support for up to 4 controllers.

Roadmap:
1. Custom controls mapping.
2. Lightbar customization.
3. Battery indicator.
4. Headphone jack support for game audio.


A huge thanks goes to:
1. ViGEm (Virtual Gamepad Emulation Driver) – For providing the essential Xbox 360 controller emulation.
2. HidHide – For allowing HID device filtering and hiding.
3. HidSharp – For handling HID device communication in C#.
4. Linux Kernel (hid-playstation.c) – For documentation on DualSense Controller.
5. The awesome Open-Source Developers & Community Discussions – For shared knowledge on DualSense input/output handling.

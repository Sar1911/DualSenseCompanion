# DualSenseCompanion

A basic companion app for the DualSense controller for windows. It will emulate an xbox 360 controller so you can play almost all pc games with your ps5 controller!

What works:
1. Xbox 360 controller emulation.
2. Vibration (only in USB mode).
3. USB connectivity.
4. Bluetooth connectivity (no vibration as of now).

What I'm currently working on:
1. Hiding the original PS5 controller to avoid conflicts with the emulated 360 controller in some games.
2. Fixing vibration when connected via Bluetooth.

What I'm planning to add in the future:
1. GUI.
2. Custom controls mapping.
3. Lightbar customization.
4. Battery indicator.
5. Headphone jack support for game audio.
